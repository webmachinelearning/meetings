## Agenda

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è WebNN W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot published

A new WebNN Candidate Recommendation Snapshot was published 11 April 2024. Since the initial Candidate Recommendation Snapshot published 30 March 2023 the group has gathered further implementation experience and added new operations and data types needed for well-known transformers to support generative AI use cases.

Join us to celebrate this milestone.

- Web Neural Network API W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot, 11 April 2024 https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-webnn-20240411/

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è NPU support discussion (cont'd)

Follow up on the NPU support discussion from our last meeting.

Assess WG readiness to incorporate basic NPU support into the spec. Continue discuss the fallback device proposal and its requirements informed by implementation experience, including backend and driver considerations. Continue discuss the set of ops required to support quantized models targeting NPU.

Please continue provide your feedback via:

- ‚®Ä WebNN should support NPU and QDQ operations https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/623
