### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Transformers.js update takeaways

We received an exciting and action-packed Transformers.js update presentation from Joshua Lochner on our June call. As a refresher, please check the animated presentation below.

>[!TIP]
>We'll revisit the feedback from this framework customer to ensure it is reflected in our WebNN work, issues and priorities appropriately.

- [Transformers.js June 2024 update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BCkLdzB5cR1ZfHwFXkIDuV8BCw8-KIWICbsZ1O00H2Q/view) ([PDF snapshot](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2024Jun/att-0004/Transformers.js-update.pdf)), [minutes with Q&A](https://www.w3.org/2024/06/27-webmachinelearning-minutes.html#t04)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Device selection + quantization & dequantization

üìå We agreed to evolve MLContextOptions and other API controls for device selection informed by further implementation experience and new use cases from the wider web community. To assist in this effort, the "npu" device type landed in Chromium and samples for fp16 models with NPU device type have been made available for experimentation.

>[!TIP]
> We'll continue solicit feedback on future-proof device selection abstractions: fallback device, multiple devices in a preferred order, an exclusion of a specific device, interaction with quantization & dequantization (QDQ) data types.

- ‚õ≠ Chromium NPU device type: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5330647
- ‚õ≠ NPU + fp16 samples: [image classification](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webnn-samples/image_classification/), [object detection](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webnn-samples/object_detection/)
- Current device selection mechanism: [device selection](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/#programming-model-device-selection), [MLContextOptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/#dictdef-mlcontextoptions)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è TAG feedback on resource contention considerations closure

The group provided the TAG a satisfactory response to their resource contention consideration issue.

>[!TIP]
>The group is now expected to close the loop by adding non-normative text for DoS vectors and mitigations (PRs welcome!), multi-implementer support feedback proposed to be addressed by making [implementation experience](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webnn-status/) more visible in the spec.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Open issues and PRs

The group made significant progress during July. Thank you!

We'll discuss new issues, debrief the group on merged PRs and review open PRs since our last meeting:

- ‚®Ä All [open issues](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues)
- ‚õô All [open pull requests](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pulls)
- ‚õô Recently [merged PRs](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged)

Priority is given to issues and PRs proposed for discussion in this meetings issue ahead the meeting:
