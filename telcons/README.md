# Teleconferences

## Scheduling

Web Machine Learning [Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webmachinelearning/) and [Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/webmachinelearning/) meet on Thursdays 15:00-16:00 UTC (summer time), interleaving between WG and CG meetings every other week.

## Recent meetings

- [Summary of the 5 most recent meetings](https://www.w3.org/services/meeting-minutes/webmachinelearning/) recorded on the W3C's IRC channel `#webmachinelearning`
- Meeting agendas are archived in [this directory](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/meetings/tree/main/telcons), minutes are linked from the agendas.

## Upcoming meetings

The meeting invites and agendas are sent to the public mailing lists of the groups approximately one week in advance. The lists are:

- WG: public-webmachinelearning-wg@w3.org ([archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webmachinelearning-wg/))
- CG: public-webmachinelearning@w3.org ([archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webmachinelearning/))

You can access the invites via the mails sent to you directly and import the attached .ics file into your calendar.

Alternatively, you can export the most recent invite via the "Meeting Calendar” links at our [Community page](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/community/):

- [Working Group Meeting Calendar](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webmachinelearning/calendar/)
- [Community Group Meeting Calendar](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/webmachinelearning/calendar/)

Please note we don't book a recurring slot, so the meeting calendar will show only the next upcoming meeting approximately one week in advance. The most convenient option is to join the groups to get invites directly.

## Joining the groups

To receive the invites to your inbox and be able to participate in full capacity, please make sure you’re a participant of the right group(s), see [joining instructions](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/community/#join).

## Contributing to the agenda

Per W3C Process, the chair defines meeting agendas with a view to facilitate consensus. Anyone can contribute by proposing meeting topics for consideration. To do so, please apply the `Agenda+` label to the GH issue if you're part of the triage team. Otherwise, please tag the chair or editors in the issue to propose.

You may also consult the specific triage guidelines, where available:
