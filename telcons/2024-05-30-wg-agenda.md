### ℹ️ NPU support 

📌 We agreed to start formalize the NPU support with the simplest design (option 1: deviceType: "npu") informed by implementation experience. Review a draft PR if available, discuss any new information and considerations brought to the group's attention in the issue.

- ⨀ WebNN should support NPU and QDQ operations https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/623
- ⛭ Chromium implementation (NPU device type) https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5330647


### ℹ️ MLBuffer

📌 Introduce and discuss the direct buffer sharing proposal. Discuss the latest on the device-based storage object. Discuss any other MLBuffer business.
